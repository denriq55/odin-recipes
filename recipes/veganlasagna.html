        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Baby portabella mushrooms</li>
        <li>Zucchini</li>
        <li>Sweet bell pepper</li>

        <li>Vegan cheese</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>While pasta is boiling, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and sauté for about 5 minutes. Add the chopped eggplant, salt and pepper, and cook for another 10 minutes until the eggplants is soft enough that the wooden spoon or spatula can slice right through it.</li>
        <li>Add in the Beyond Meat crumbles and stir to combine. Cook for about 3 minutes</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium low, add in all the tomato sauces and stir to combine, for about 3 minutes. Taste and add salt accordingly. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Begin Building the Lasagna:</strong> In a pan, add 1/2 cup of “meat” marinara sauce mixture on the bottom and spread with a spatula to create an even bottom layer. Cover the bottom with about 4 lasagna noodles lengthwise, overlapping a bit. This will be your first layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Continue Building:</strong> Next, add about some of the “meat” marinara sauce mixture (just ensure you have enough for 4 even layers) and then about 1/3 of the remaining vegan mozzarella. Repeat layers until you have reached the top layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong>Cover the pan with foil and bake in the oven for 30 minutes covered. Then broil for about 3-5 minutes of low broil to brown the cheese on top. Allow to set up on the counter for about 10 minutes before cutting into slices. Cut into 9 or 12 even slices. <strong>Serve and enjoy!</strong></li>
