<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Corn tortillas</li>
        <li>Mashed potatoes</li>
        <li>Plant-Based cheese</li> 
        <li>Your favorite kind of oil for frying</li>
        <li>Hot sauce and/or avocado salsa for serving. For the avocado salsa Just mix together diced avocados, tomatoes, and jalapenos with cilantro, lime juice, a drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of salt </li>
    </ul>   
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the tortilla on a clean surface. Spread a spoonful of the mashed potatoes on one half of the tortilla, leaving the other half empty so it can be folded over later. Repeat this step for all of the tortillas.</li>
        <li>Pour some vegetable oil into a large skillet. Youâ€™ll need just enough to cover the bottom. Put your taco in the skillet and place some vegan cheese right on top of the mashed potatoes. Wait for 15-20 seconds and then gently fold the empty side on top of the potato side.</li>
        <li>Fry each taco for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>To make the Avocado Salsa, simply mix all of the salsa ingredients in a small bowl and add on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and enjoy!</strong></li>
